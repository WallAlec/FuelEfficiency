# FuelEfficiency
This is a small data science project using Python that analyzes a dataset containing information about automobile fuel efficiency, 
specifically miles per gallon (MPG). I sourced this from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This project:
Loads the auto-mpg dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Preprocesses the data by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Selects features and target variables.
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains a linear regression model.
Makes predictions using the test set and evaluates the model using mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
Plots actual vs predicted MPG values to visualize the model's performance.
