Time Series Analysis on Automotive Fuel Efficiency 

Objective:

Explore and predict automobile fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon or mpg) using historical data.

Data Source
Utilized the "Auto MPG" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset provides features such as vehicle displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, and model year.

Key Steps
Data Preparation: Addressed missing values and anomalies to ensure a clean dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed a thorough analysis to grasp the dataset's distribution, correlations, and underlying relationships.
Modeling: Implemented a linear regression model to predict mpg based on vehicle characteristics.
Performance Evaluation: Assessed the model using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric, achieving a value of 10.5024.
Baseline Comparison: The model's performance was benchmarked against a baseline model that predicts the mean mpg for all observations. Our model showcased significantly better results than the baseline MSE of 51.6203.
Conclusion
This project establishes a foundational model for predicting automobile fuel efficiency. While outperforming a simple mean-based prediction, potential exists for further model refinement and accuracy enhancement. The insights gleaned are of value to both automobile consumers and industry stakeholders.
